# Keyboard Accents Above Vowels

## Windows

Use the ALT+ASCII Number:

If you hold down ALT and type in the number 160, you get á.

### Other ALT key combinations

- á 160
- é 130  
- í 161
- ú 163
- É 144  
- ¿ 268
- ì 173
- ó 162
- ñ 164
- Ñ 165

#### Setting up the keyboard

In Windows, you can set your keyboard to "United States - International" and use the ` and ~ keys to add the accents.

If that doesn't work, here is a website that talks about other Windows OS keyboard options.

## Macintosh

For accented vowels: type `⌥e`, followed by the vowel you want accented

- For ñ: type ⌥n, then n
- For Ñ: type ⌥n, then ⇧n
- For ü: type ⌥u, then u
- For Ü: type ⌥u, then ⇧u
- For ¡: type ⌥1
- For ¿: type ⇧⌥?

### Notes

`⌥` is the option key (also called opt or alt).

⇧ is the shift key.

Keys grouped together on a single key above should be typed in simultaneously.

## Linux

First, you must assign a **compose key** (how depends on which window manager you use). My favorite compose key is the Windows/Menu key. Then:

- For accented vowels, compose, ', vowel
- For ñ: compose, ~, n
- For ü: compose, ", u
- For ¿: compose, ?, ?
- For ¡: compose, !, !
- For «: compose, <, <
- For »: compose, >, >
