## [Using cURL with Tor](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/making-tor-requests-command-line-curl)

 Making requests with the Tor network is easy with cURL. Since Tor uses the common SOCKS5 protocol, it works well with anything that has SOCKS5 support. cURL comes with a simple command-line option to specify a proxy.

If you do not already have Tor setup, you can follow these instructions for setting up Tor in Linux or download the Tor Browser Bundle.

### Linux default Tor proxy port is 9050

```bash
curl --socks5-hostname localhost:9050 https://check.torproject.org
```

### Windows/Tor Browser Bundle default to port 9150

```bash
curl --socks5-hostname localhost:9150 https://check.torproject.org
```
