# Memory Learning And Understanding

[How to Remember Everythin You Learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-UvSKe8jW4)

1. Recall
   - After reading / watching a video, simply look away and recall the keypoints, material you just took in and repeat.
2. Feynman Technique
   1. Take something you want to Understanding
   2. Write out an explanation as if you were teaching it to someone who didn't understand the subject.
   3. Whenever you get stuck, go back to the material and re-learn.  Fill in the gaps in your knowledge until yyou can write an explanation **without** source material.
   4. Simplify. (Get rid of technical/convoluted language).
      1. Analogies - defining complex ideas to something more relatable
3. Spaced Repetition
   1. Neurons that fire together, wire together
   2. Space out by 3 days for several weeks.

Quote Kat Turnbull:
"It seems to be in our nature to focus on how ww were wrong over the fact that we're now smarter (as if we can't be works in progress), and we often attach our egos to what we believe.  A view is just how you see something. It doesn't have to define you, and trying to detach from it to gain understanding can be a very good thing."
