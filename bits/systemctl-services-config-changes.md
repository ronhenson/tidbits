# Systemctl Services Config Changes

## Example using a change with postgres database location change

```bash
systemctl edit postgresql.service
```

```config
## Added the following as an example
[Service]
Environment=PGDATA=/data/pgsql/data
```

The above suppose to write the changes to:
``` /etc/systemd/system/postgresql.d/override.conf ```
It kept cancelling, so I create the directory and file and made the changes.
It worked.

## Restart systemctl daemon

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload

# Started up the service
systemctl enable postgresql.service
systemctl start postgresql.service
systemctl status postgresql.service
```

- Install postgresql and pgadmin [[postgresql-install]]
- Issue installing psycopg2 [[postgresql13-install-psycopg2-issue-210727]]
