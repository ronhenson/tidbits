</blockquote>

<p>History:</p>

<pre>
  Ctrl + r   Recall the last command including the specified character(s)

  Ctrl + n   Next command in history (i.e. walk forward through the command history)

  Ctrl + s   Go back to the next most recent command.

  Ctrl + g   Escape from history searching mode
        !!   Repeat last command
         !   <i>abc</i>   Run last command starting with <i>abc</i><br>
         !   <i>abc</i>:p   Print last command starting with <i>abc</i><br>
        !$   Last argument of previous command<br>

<p>Process control:</p>

<pre> 
 Ctrl + C   Interrupt/Kill whatever you are running (SIGINT)
 Ctrl + l   Clear the screen
 Ctrl + s   Stop output to the screen (for long running verbose commands)
            Then use PgUp/PgDn for navigation
 Ctrl + q   Allow output to the screen (if previously stopped using command above)
 Ctrl + D   Send an EOF marker, unless disabled by an option, this will close the current shell (EXIT)
 Ctrl + Z   Send the signal SIGTSTP to the current task, which suspends it.
            To return to it later enter <a href="fg.html">fg</a> 'process name' (foreground).</pre>

<p><b>Emacs mode vs Vi Mode</b></p>

<p>All the above assume that bash is running in the default Emacs setting, if you prefer this can be switched to <a href="../vi.html">Vi</a> shortcuts instead. </p>

<p>Set Vi Mode in bash:</p>

<pre>
$ set -o vi
</pre>

<p>Set Emacs Mode in bash:</p>

<pre>
$ set -o emacs
</pre>
