<h1 style="color:purple;"> 6 Tabata Tips </h1>

<div class="bord">

To get the most out of your Tabata workout, follow these guidelines:

# Warm up for at least 10 minutes. That's part of the original protocol.

# Use full-body exercises that engage as many muscle groups as possible.

# Exercises using bodyweight, a weighted vest, or free weights are all acceptable.

# Go full-tilt during the 20-second bursts. Seriously, don't slow down.

# Try hard to find your breath during the 10-second rests. Good luck.

# Be prepared to sweat â€¦ a lot.
