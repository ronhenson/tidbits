# Brain Wave Frequencies

[What are binaural beats](https://organicdailypost.com/binaural-beats-actually-work)

Brain wave activity can be observed with a tool called an “EEG” or Electroencephalograph

## Theta Waves (4-8 Hz) 

* Theta brain waves are again quite slow. This state is often achieved naturally in the early stages of sleep, and is thought to result in increased creativity combined with a state of deep relaxation [3].
* As such, many individuals implement the theta brainwave in conjunction with meditation to further improve their meditative state, increasing feelings of calmness and mental clarity.
* These same individuals have been said to use the theta wave to improve creativity, which may have some capacity to improve artistic potential.

## Alpha Waves (8-14 Hz) 

* Alpha waves are used to induce a state that we can describe as relaxed, but aware. Alpha waves are typically experienced during routine tasks such as gardening, taking a shower, or doing light housework, during which we are present, yet our winds also wander freely [4].
* Alpha waves are thought to allow a state of relaxed focus, which may contribute to improve learning (which is a HUGE positive) in conjunction with a large reduction in stress. This is also thought to come with an increase in creativity in comparison to higher frequency brainwaves.

## Beta Waves (14-30 Hz) 

* Beta wave is essentially the most common brainwave pattern. These brainwaves are produced when we are wide awake, alert, and actively engaged in an activity.
* Beta Waves are essentially where we spend the bulk of our day.
* Being in a beta wave is thought to improve our ability to focus on external stimuli, while also showing strong associations with analytical thinking and problem solving. This makes us better at handling realistic situations that require both logic and rational thinking [5].

## Gamma Waves (30-100 Hz) 

* Gamma waves are currently thought to be the highest brainwave capable of being achieved by the brain, and as such have shown strong associations with increased mental activity, vastly increased abilities of perception, greatly improved problem solving skills, and greater memory recall [6].
* This suggest that we may be able to use gamma waves to improve our productivity, particularly during logical tasks that require minimal creative thinking.
* Interestingly, those individuals who spend more time in a gamma state have also been said to demonstrate more compassion than their counterparts, while also showing exceptional intellect and cognitive function.
